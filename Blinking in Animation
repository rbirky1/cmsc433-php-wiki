I just saw a commercial on TV starring a character who had a severe blinking problem.
Now, I don’t mean the character blinked too much. I don’t mean he blinked too fast. I don’t mean the character’s blinks were too far offset, too slow, or too few.No, this character was plagued by a disease that has been running rampant through animation.
Let’s call it '''Randomblinkitis.'''Many animated characters currently living out their lives on demo reels around the world suffer from this terrible disease, causing their blinks to feel random and meaningless.Look around. Do you see anyone who is blinking every 2 seconds?! (If you do, please report them to your government, because chances are they are some kind of android spy from Mars or something.)

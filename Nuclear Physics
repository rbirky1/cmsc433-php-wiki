The '''atomic nucleus''' consists of nucleonsâ€”protons and neutrons. Protons and
neutrons are made of ''quarks'' and held together by the strong force generated by ''gluon''
exchange between quarks. In nuclei with many nucleons, the effective strong forces may be
described by the exchange of ''mesons'' (particles composed of quark-antiquark pairs). A
proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark along with short-lived constituents of
the ''strong force'' field. A neutron is similar except that it has two down quarks and one up
quark. Although scientists are convinced that nucleons are composed of quarks, a single
quark has never been isolated experimentally. Energy brought into a nucleus to try to
separate quarks increases the force between them. At high enough energy, the addition of
energy creates new particles rather than freeing the quarks.

Planning is probably the most essential tool in your entire animation toolbox, especially in the first few years of your animation life. You should never sit down in front of your computer, animation disc or puppet, until you know exactly what poses you are planning to use, when you are planning to use them, and why.
Before you begin any shot, it’s so important to study references, work out your thumbnails, and make your timing and acting decisions on paper. This may seem like an “extra” step to some of you, but believe me, it will save you time in the long run and your work will look so much stronger than it would have otherwise.

The first thing you absolutely have to do is OBSERVE.  Observation is much more than simply “seeing” something interesting - it’s ACTIVELY studying the world around us. Sure, a certain amount of curiosity is natural, but you have to take your natural curiosity for noticing things and train yourself to crank that curiosity knob to 11 if you want to become an animator.

There are many types of reference materials that will be invaluable to you as an animator. Photography, comic-books, live-action movie reference, animated reference, and footage of yourself and your friends acting out a scene will all be incredibly useful as you sit down to plan your shot. It might be the most practical and useful planning of all, in fact.

The '''serval''' (''Leptailurus serval'') is among the feline family’s most successful. It has a small, delicate head and extremely large ears set on an elongated neck, long slim legs (hind legs longer than front), long slender body and a short tail.

Servals are found in well-watered savannah long-grass environments, and are associated with reed beds and other riparian vegetation types. 

Servals are solitary animals, and social interactions are limited to periods of mating.

The serval’s sensitive hearing allows it to locate small mammals moving through the grass or underground, and to hunt its prey sometimes without seeing it until the final pounce. It also has the ability to leap vertically and catch prey such as birds, right out of the air.

'''Burrowing owls''' (''Athene cunicularia'') are so named because they live underground in burrows that have been dug out by small mammals like ground squirrels and prairie dogs. They are covered in brown spotted feathers and have long legs. They also sport distinctive white “eyebrows” above bright yellow eyes. They are one of the smallest owls in North America.

Burrowing owls eat small mammals.

Burrowing owls are distributed from the Mississippi to the Pacific and from the Canadian prairie provinces into South America. They are also found in Florida and the Caribbean islands.

Unlike other owls, burrowing owls are active during the day, especially in the spring when they gather food for their large broods. 

Burrowing owls make a tremulous chuckling or chattering call. They also bob their heads to express excitement or distress. When alarmed, young birds will make a hissing call that sounds like a rattlesnake.
